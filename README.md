## Overview

Master advanced pointer usage for embedded systems including function pointers, pointer arithmetic, qualifiers (`const`/`volatile`), and memory-mapped I/O.

## Code Explained

- Uses a `volatile` pointer to simulate memory-mapped register access.
- Demonstrates dynamic memory with pointer arithmetic on buffers.
- Shows `const` and `volatile` qualifiers and pointer-to-pointer.
- Invokes functions via pointer-to-function for flexible callbacks.
